Sometimes, software can be conned into doing things it shouldn't.  I work on
making software less gullible.  I explain this analogy in a bit more detail in
my first [post]({% post_url _posts/2022-11-09-software-gullibility %}).

For the bulk of my career, I worked at a small spinoff from Cornell University
called GrammaTech.  While there I worked on tons of challenging and interesting
projects.  Along the way, I co-authored a fair number of papers on my work.
However, my charge was always to develop novel technology and win
government-funded research contracts.  Often those contracts had pre-publication
review clauses that hampered public disclosure, at least during the contract.

As a consequence, my digital footprint feels relatively small.  I did not tweet
about the work as it happened.  We mostly did not release or contribute to open
source projects.  With this blog, I plan to expand on and clarify some of our
published results.

Of course, I will write about other topics that are of interest to me.

One of my goals is to practice writing.  For the time being, I reserve the right
to edit past posts without warning or notice.  Should I actually attact an
audience, I'll likely change that practice.  I am a long way from an audience.
